# Game
Just a game. Nothing to say. Made with Python3.11.0 and pyinstaller.
Well, because here's the WHOLE sourcecode you can mainly do whatever you want with it.
here are some tips.
1.you can steal the code, but if i find out i will be very angry.
2.you can cheat, but that's your choice, if i was you, I would beat it properly.
3.Just to be clear, I wrote all the code.
4.enjoy!
